# Movie-Genre-Prediction-with-Spark
Task 1 : In this task, we have to find the number of times that a word appears in the documents. 
Task 2 : In this task, we find the top 10 trigrams present in the three documents using the three keywords: Science,sea,fire.
Task 3 : In this task we have to implement a MapReduce algorithm to produce inverted indexes for the given dataset.
Task 4 : In this task, we have to implement a MapReduce algorithm which can join two datasets using a primary key which in our case is the Employee ID. We convert the input files into .csv files using tab separator. We have attached the csv files that we have used along with the python files.
Please read the Report for additional details about implementation.
