# Movie-Genre-Prediction-with-Spark
In this project, we perform text classification on movie dataset to predict the genre of a movie given the plot of the movie.In the dataset, we are given 31108 movieid,movie names,plot and genres that correspond to the movie. <br />
Each movie can have multiple genres associated with it. So this project is an example of a multi-label classification project. <br />
